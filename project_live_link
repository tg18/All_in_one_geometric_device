- Primary objective is to design a geometric device which can perform most of the functions of the tools found in a geometric
box while having a compact size.
– Successfully created a enhanced design of a compass which could perform the basic functions of a ruler, divider, protractor, compass while being 17cm*5cm wide.
– Future iterations of the model are envisioned to include even more functionalities like those of a set square while being made
more compact in size.
